## Agent Rules

This project defines all agent-specific rules in **AGENTS.md**.  
Claude Code and Codex must load these rules from that file.

- The canonical rule set is maintained in `AGENTS.md`.
- CLAUDE.md only provides Claude-specific conventions.
- For any cross-agent behavior, refer to **AGENTS.md**.

Please read `AGENTS.md` before modifying agent configurations.
